The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This is often caused by asynchronous operations.  For example, if you fetch data with `get()` and immediately try to access a field, it may be undefined, leading to an error.  Another issue arises when you're using `onSnapshot` and data changes frequently, and your logic doesn't handle initial null values gracefully. Incorrect data structure assumptions can also cause problems, where you expect a specific field type but receive a different one, resulting in a runtime error.
